      "title": "",
      "content"	 : "Dear Endicott,In June 2016 your mother informed me of your passing.  Her message was clear.  “My son is gone.  I’ll let you know when I can talk about it.”  I was in the Ozarks at the time, celebrating my nephews wedding and my sister’s remission from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.  My entire family was there.  Your mother’s news couldn’t have been more of a juxtaposition to the events that brought us there.  Who knew that seven months later, the A.L.L. would be back and the depth of grief your family had experienced would now be known by mine. Your mother and I can now talk about it.The interesting thing is that during that June vacation, I was in the midst of leaving my then job and pursuing two other options.  One was doing the same job I was then doing.  It would be about the same pay, the same drive, and the same challenges.  The other opportunity would be something totally new.  Starting a new career in my early fifties.  Fear was driving me to take the job I knew I could be good at. However, your life ended up having a huge impression upon mine.  Every time your mother or father and I met professionally, we would always share what our kids were doing.  College.  Exams.  Driving. Dating.  The most interesting stories at the time were always the ones that were the answer to my question, “How’s Endi?”  Over time, while I never met you, I was able to learn a little bit about how you viewed life.  All in.  No holds barred.  In reflecting over my career decisions, I realized I could play it safe or I could live it all in.  No holds barred. Because of you, I chose the new path…the new direction. Webster’s defines impression as “a characteristic, trait, or feature resulting from some influence.”  “Stamp.”  “Imprint.”  Life is amazing to me when I consider how someone I never met lived their life in a way that imprinted itself upon mine.  Your perspective on life continues to live on, Endicott.  Therefore, you live on…continuing to influence the rest of us to not hold back, to leave an impression and make a difference.    ",

      "content"	 : "Two years today that you so suddenly left us. The universe was crying with us yesterday in Sydney as I thought of you. There are so many memories I have of us, of you, at Johns and at Tama. I went down with Soph and Dana and we brought you the closest thing I could get to daisies - your mum had told me previously when she visited how you used to pick flowers for her. What a chivalrous gentleman you were Endo!!!!! Whenever I come down to Tama and talk to you I can feel you there. Whether it’s a cold breeze or a feeling inside that just assures me I’m not alone and some mad woman talking out to the ocean with nobody around. But last night more than ever. You were there as my feet were hugged by the ocean that took you, you were there when I curled up into the side of the rocks where we sat that time sheltered from the storm that came over, and you were there as we left just sitting on the edge of a rock and left us a toy truck to let us know. Your mother then told me how you had lost a toy truck as a child and that brought me to tears because it was the biggest sign I’ve ever received from you. I miss you each and every day and I wish I had the chance to say so many more things to you. Thank you for looking out for me and guarding me and giving me the strength to pull through the hard times, just as you helped me through them at Johns. I know you are looking out for the rest of your famil and friends too and you truly are an angel Endo. I’ve had heaps of heartbreaks as you probably know, but this is none like any other. I miss you and I love you. Forever yours Al. 💕",

      "title": "",
      "content"	 : "Oh Endi. Every day without you is so painful, almost more than I can bear. So when I tell you that today is the worst day in a long time, that should really tell you something. Since you can’t be here with me, I thought I’d write you a letter.We took your brother Simon to college yesterday. The University of Pittsburgh, but you know that. He’s an amazing young man, and you deserve a lot of the credit for how great he is. I never like to compare Simon to you too much, because he deserves to be his own person (and he is), but I also know that you loved having a younger brother and you saw in him an opportunity to shape him and make him (almost) as cool and confident as you. You succeeded. He’s going to thrive, and you’ll always be a part of him.When you were little, remember, people said you and Holden were like twins. Always together, and him always looking out for you. Then, as you got older, you went in your own directions (as it should be), and I think you felt that in many ways you were very different from Holden. But when you learn that he is in Senegal, in the Peace Corps, helping others, you see just how similar you two have always been. Same spirit of adventure, same sense of no boundaries, same desire to make the world a better place, same confidence and big heart.Hannah, your rival and beloved big sister, is a lawyer in New Hampshire (but you know that, too). She, too, is helping others as a public defender. As much as you loved to complete with Hannah, I know you must be very proud to see the good that she is doing. You, too, have always had a powerful sense of justice.I am so proud of all of them. And I am proud of you, too, Endi. What a truly incredible young man. What a wonderful son to have had in my life.The day before we took Simon to college, he rolled into the driveway in his Jeep with the windows rolled down and the music loud. Just like you used to. At the time it made me smile (the truth is I think about you and smile all the time, because of your sheer awesomeness). But now I am remembering that, and I am crying. I want you to be here with us so much. Right now, by my side, where you are supposed to be.Endi, I love you. More than these words or any can ever say. Love, Father. August 22, 2018",

      "title": "",
      "content"	 : "I think about you every day, Endi. And I miss you so much.The time I spent with you was an adventure and not one second was wasted. I remember the first time I met you very well. It was in 2012, at Washington Airport and I just got there from Germany, very nervous about meeting my host family. You came up to me with your big smile, you were very excited and handed me a super corny ‘I LOVE YOU’ balloon. From that point, I knew you were a joker and that we would have a good time!The next year you came to Germany, and I am still so thankful you went and joined my Football Team during your stay. We had just transferred to the highest Youth American Football League in Germany and it was a close fight for staying in the league. You joined the practice, and the other kids including me just didn’t stand a chance when going against you in drills. Eventually, I stood on the field with you in the final game of the season. I’m happy to be able to say that. It was a great honor. The impact you made on that game was unbelievable. You played as a tight end and defensive end - to you it was business as usual. We were on offense and I remember rolling out and throwing you a terribly high pass on your out-route. Instead of letting it pass, you gave it all, jumped what felt like three meters high and made a spectacular one-handed grab. At the latest from then on everybody in the entire club knew who the ‘American kid’ was. We won the game and it was very close, it was like a movie. You helped save my team from going back to League 2 and the coach likes to reminisce on that day. He always says if it wasn’t for you, we wouldn’t have made it and I agree. The team went on evolving and reached the Juniorbowl in 2015, two years later. It was so beautiful. You helped a big bunch of kids make incredible memories there, that they will remember for a lifetime. The coach and the entire team send their condolences to the Ackerman family. Endi, you have left your mark here and everyone on the team remembers you very well and loves you!I had the privilege to come visit you and your lovely family again in 2014. It was one of the most exciting summers I ever had. I learned a lot from you during that time. You were a winner. I could tell by the way you turned off your phone after losing a game of ‘connect four’ on it, the way you focused when laying table tennis and the way you tackled your workouts: The Endi way. If you were in it, you were in it for 100% and you were in it to win. You made me strive to become a winner, too. You showed me how to eat right for building up muscle, which is Chipotle every day for those who don’t know. I remember how we used to sneak out of your parents’ house through the roof at night to go meet friends. I thought it was fantastic. Really, every day spent with you was an adventure.I always wanted you to come visit me in Germany or in England this past year, but it just didn’t work out. I just wish we could have sat at the fireplace one more time and talk about the memories we made together and share what we are up to. I would have loved to see what kind of man you have become. I am 1000% sure you would have been someone people love to be around, because you were generous, funny, a leader with a lot of energy and an inspiring human being.I have always heard that people live on in our memories. I think what’s even better is to let you live on in my deeds.I want to be brave, confident, loving and give life my all, just like you.I love you Endi.And I love you so much, Mr. and Mrs. Ackerman. Thank you for making it possible, that your son and I became friends. There is so much love in your family and I feel blessed to have lived with you. For so long I didn’t know what to say to you in those dark times but now I know: I love you, and also Holden, Hannah and my little tall buddy Simon, who has probably grown so much. I miss you all.",

      "title": "A Reflection of Endicott",
      "content"	 : "A Reflection –Given by Liz Dixon, Endicott’s motherRequiem Mass for Endicott AckermanSt John’s College Chapel18 August 2016The Ackerman Family wants to express our heartfelt thanks to all the students of St. John’s, the leadership of St. John’s, the staff of W.B. Bull Funeral Home, the U.S. Consulate and of course, Endicott’s beloved friends. The outpouring of love and support has given us the strength to continue this now altered journey of life for all of us. We are taking ½ days at a time and it has and will continue to be our heart breaking process – a life on earth without Endicott.One of the most difficult aspects of grief, is the loss of potential. And with Endicott there was so much potential. In everything. When he was little one of my nick-names for him was Spark-A- Lark. He’d walk in a room and he’d look up at you with those big brown eyes and you just knew something was going to happen, most likely fun, a game of wit, mischief or a combination of the three.He’s had that same confident, grab the world by the horns attitude since he was two. Nothing was ever going to stop him once he put his mind to it.In his senior year of high school, Endi announced that he was going to take a gap year before going to college, to travel and figure out where it was he wanted to go and what he wanted to study. We said “Okay” but you must do something extraordinary and not let the year slip by you.He came home two weeks later and informed us that he secured a working visa and a job in the Outback working on a cattle ranch. Sam and I looked at each other and said “What?”Endi gave us that grin and smiled, “I always wanted to be a cowboy.”So on the way to the airport for his first departure we reminded him that he was going to have to apply to schools for college while away. We asked for a short list and his reply was “University of Sydney, they have a great medical program.” I knew right then that it would be a long time until he returned to the states to stay.I visited Endi here at St. John’s and explored Sydney this past March. I am so blessed to have walked through all the neighborhoods with him. We visited some of his favorite restaurants, enjoyed the Barber of Seville at the Opera House, we walked the Botanical Gardens, shopped and met some of his wonderful friends. We took the ferry to Manly Island and of course walked the coastal walk, and I experienced Bondi Beach with him hand in hand.As we were walking he mentioned to me that wherever he ended up in this world he had to be near the ocean. He needed to swim every day of his life in it. I asked about medical schools and he quickly replied Sydney, South Africa and Scotland.He shared with me that his goal was to live all over the world in three year time-spans. To experience life and its cultures.The world is a big place.What I ask each of you is to keep Endi’s spirit alive, have fun, read good books, do amazing works, drink good drinks mixed properly, love your family, adopt a dog, keep the faith.Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote:“It is not length of life, but depth of life.”Endi was my gift from heaven and that he will always be.Thank you.",

Endicott really left a marked impression on me with his confidence, firm handshake, eye contact and sensitivity. I often asked Jack about him. I think he really loved Australia and the love was clearly reciprocal. When it was thought to be Endicott who was lost at sea I prayed that he would be found safley and that he would appear somewhere with that cheeky smile firmly in tact. My friend Pastor played the organ at today’s vigil at college and he was really moved by the occasion and by the power Liz of your eulogy. I wished to be there myself.

Endicott, being American, knew how big of a deal Halloween was and wouldn’t settle for anything less. I think my favourite part of the night was just us 4 getting ready in my room. The fake cut on Endo’s arm took me about 40 minutes of layer tissue paper and painting blood, but it obviously wasn’t enough for him as he poured the red paint all over his hands and smeared it over his body.

      "content"	 : "Dear Endi,First of all, I miss you. Secondly, I’m writing to you from the beach in Wilmington and it’s 6:11am right now (this was kind of an impulsive excursion) and it’s the first time I’ve been to the water since everything happened. I know you’d think that’s weird because you know I love the ocean, and the weather has been perfect, and I live 5 minutes away, and yes, now I can see you rolling your eyes at me and shaking your head in disappointment… but anyway, I’ve just been very hesitant to come back. But I want you to know that being here is bringing me more peace and clarity than I’ve had in weeks. I think I really needed the air and the sounds and the solidarity to collect my thoughts. So this is where I am with it; here are some thoughts and memories that come to mind…It’s no Rehoboth, but I can still smell Nicola’s and Grotto’s pizza, and I remember how my stomach felt that time I tried to keep up with you, slice for slice. I know that any beach I visit, I’ll think of you, and the memories that will rush back will be happy ones. And the beach isn’t the only place I’ll think of you, because I know I’m going to visit my favorite place from my childhood. And you happen to be a very big part of why that place exists for me. When I visit camp, Endi, I’ll sit on the bluff bench and remember our ‘corny’ conversations about the future of friendship, I’ll think about all the traditions we said we’d continue, and how you made my laugh echo off the bay at 3am. And, Endi, when I play volleyball, my lifelong pastime, I’ll think about how I was going to go to Tamarama beach with you, and I’ll remember to make plans to go there to play. Also, I wasn’t sure if I could handle it at first, but now I know that my first puppy will be a Leonberger. I really can’t wait to love that dog, Endi. I hope the backyard will be big enough. If it is, I’ll want to play ultimate, and I know that all my best disc tosses I’ll have learned from you.I’m never going to forget categories in the pool. It doesn’t even bother me that you won, EVERY time. No matter what obscure category your dad could come up with. I never figured out if it was because you were just really good at quick thinking in mid-air or if it was because of your athleticism. Could be both. I’m positive that you gave yourself extra milliseconds by treading water during your descent. Endi, I want you to know how much you mean to me. There’s no way to describe growing up so close in age to someone whose family is so close to mine. Parts of my personality are due to the hours and hours we’ve spent together. You’ve shown me ways to live that I would have never seen from anyone else, shown me things to smile at that I wouldn’t have appreciated otherwise. Your wit is clever and constant and sarcastic and sometimes hilariously inappropriate,…I wonder where you get it from (;  And you are so kind… So deeply kind and genuine and gentle and passionate and I know where you get that from…the humor and love is family wide.That picture of us on the stairs is absolutely my favorite picture, and undoubtedly a perfect still frame of my love for you, and how I have loved you since I was at least that small. And I always will love you, Endi. Thank you for giving me plenty of stories to tell my children, and thank you for teaching me things that I could have only learned from someone as humorous and brotherly as you. So, Endicott, thank you for every memory, and thank you for being such a significant part of my childhood, because I know that, even now, you are capable of evoking pieces of me that no one else can.I started writing this three weeks ago, and it’s taken me this long to realizethat this letter to you will never be finished…The sunrise was spectacular this morning, Endi, I’m sure you saw it from wherever you are. I know you’d call me a lame tourist for it, but I watched the sky from the splintery lifeguard stand.You are forever a part of my life, Endi. I hope to live as freely and passionately as you. I won’t stop learning from your example. I want to help people I love to live like that too.You will forever have my love. You were truly my first love. And none of that will ever change. I will always have moments where I think of you, and I know that I’m not alone in this. You’ll always be with us, Endi. And I have no doubt that I will one day see you again.Bella",

      "title": "",
      "content"	 : "Endi. What would I do differently if you were here? Would I call you? Make an effort to spend time with you while you were home visiting? Write you an email just to see how you were doing in Australia? Unlikely. I was nobody important in your life, just another person on the periphery of some circle of family acquaintances; a down-the-street neighbor; Simon’s friend’s Mother; nobody, really. But I can’t help but wish so strongly that you were here, and that I could spend some time just talking with you. Perhaps I would have seen you again at this year’s Christmas party - I was hoping for a foosball rematch. I believe the first words I ever spoke to you were, “your name precedes you,” because before I ever met you, I knew you through your Mother’s stories and through Anthony and Simon’s eyes as the popular, older guy they looked up to.Not a day has passed since I heard the tragic news that I have not thought of you and your family. Not one day. I’m not like you, Endi. I don’t live a fearless, adventurous life; quite the contrary. But the most amazing thing has happened – I would have presumed that your death would justify and reaffirm my anxieties, but for some reason, I feel compelled to live more adventurously – and to accept that there is risk inherent in everything we do, and to do it anyway. And not just for me, but for my boys. It’s uncomfortable to think of the possibility that I may outlive my children, but I cannot deny that this possibility exists. Regardless of which one of us goes first, you and your parents have taught me to work hard to give my kids the best possible life with the richest possible experiences. To identify their strengths and what makes them unique and to celebrate them for it. To give them the freedom to explore their worlds, and the confidence in knowing that no matter where they go or what they do, they will always, always be loved.For the first time, I took my kids on a long trip. We went to Switzerland and Germany. For many years and for just as many reasons I have been afraid of doing so – the flight was too long and too expensive, the surroundings too uncertain, and in recent years, that Anthony was too tall to comfortably fit on a plane (or in a plane bathroom). But I did it. And as beautiful as the trip was, I spent much of the time watching my kids experience life. Watching them watching the lakes, rivers, and mountains; watching them absorb another culture; watching their worlds expand.Our last morning in Geneva, I woke Anthony up early and we walked through the city to get breakfast. We sat outside, I drank coffee and Anthony had an apple cinnamon crumble as people walked through the plaza and an accordion played in the background. What a memory. Inspired by you, dear Endi. Rana",

We laughed a lot, drank a lot, and pointed out all the girls on the brink of tipping over in their too high heels. We got back to my house and stargazed a little until you fell asleep on the ground wrapped in my purple blanket. Which I made sure to document! The entire night you were a complete gentleman never leaving my side.

      "content"	 : "We met each other in 7th grade and I gave you my number a few weeks later. One night we stayed up texting very late talking about how lame the middle school dances were and how we never attended one. I told you that the only dance I’d consider going to would be prom senior year. You promised that night you would be my date no matter what. I didn’t take it that seriously because no one could know where we’d be 5 years into the future… until the spring time of senior year quickly came and I asked if you remembered the silly 7th grade text promise. You did, you weren’t one to forget things. One day at the gym while you were stretching and I was pretending to do sit-ups next to you, you asked me what my favorite type of flower was and I said Stargazer Lily’s. Sure enough, the next morning you took off your shirt to make sure everyone knew your chiseled abs hadn’t gone anywhere, and you walked up to me at my locker with a poster saying “I ABSolutely hope you say yes to prom” and a bouquet of Stargazer Lily’s. I was so incredibly excited because a dream guy and an amazing person that any girl would have been ecstatic to go to prom with asked me. You didn’t forget or break your promise. A few minutes later as I was trying to keep my blushing under control and all the girls around us were staring with hearts in their eyes you were whistled at by an admin member and told to put your shirt back on. Which you did, very slowly, with the most perfect Endicott smile on your face.",

      "content"	 : "Growing up in the neighborhood that I did I had one friend my age, Kevin Graine, and when I heard that a new family was moving in I was ecstatic to say the least especially when I heard that they had four children. When Endi first moved in I remember our first encounter being an awkward one to say the least just trying to get a feel for what the other person was like. However I knew then and there I would have a friend for life. Endi, Simon, Holden, and I would do anything possible in the small town we lived in, anything ranging from hiking in the woods, to walking to the Clifton store for soda and candy or making a raving talk show to uploading to YouTube staring a spunky meatball shaped stuffed animal of Endi’s. (https://www.youtube.com/user/StingoFeelTheSting you can view all the wonderful episodes here). Endi was an inspiration to me growing up he was everything I wanted to be, strong, kind, athletic,funny, smart, and a plethora of other  great qualities. I looked up to him so much weather he knew that or not he was what drove me to do better in school and better myself as a person and I have great relief knowing that Endi has not just blessed me, but many others around the world with his wit, knowledge and all around fanatic character. Not a day goes by where I don’t think about Endi and one thing I think about most is that I wish we would have talked more. When I moved in 5th grade we kept up contact somewhat but as life got busier and schedules became more packed I found myself not reaching out as much and this is the one thing I regret more than anything was thinking that I had more time. I would give anything to talk to Endi again. The last conversation I remember having with him was because I was having trouble remembering the name of Archers ringtone (Archer was one of Endis favorite shows) and withing 5 minutes of me asking I had a reply form him telling me exactly the name bringing an instant smile to my face. I miss you Endi and I wanted to say thank you for all that you have taught me. Also, Thank you to the Ackerman family. I remember countless dinners and sleepovers at your house. Playing Xbox in the basement, the arcade machine, air hockey table, fooseball,. and ping pong. Swimming in your ool (notice how there’s no P in it, they liked to keep it that way). Memories like these I will hold forever and cherish for a lifetime. I’m so sorry for your loss and Mr. Sam, I’d like to take you up on that offer. I think I have a great middle name for my first son.Love and Warm Regards,Andrew Farlow ",

It is also the last time they were on different teams. After that, working with Sam, they came up with complicated strategies to work the system (like the optimal picking order and intentionally performing poorly at try-outs) so that they would always play together. Or rather, they informed Coach Sam of the strategy needed to get the right group of players on the team. Flag football was a much more relaxed game with minimal practices and simpler uniforms. But Endi was never particularly relaxed about playing hard, always playing intensely but really having fun. The last two years of high school, Endi and Charlie also coached Simon’s team and truly reveled in employing some of the same strategies to form this team and figuring out plays to surprise their opponents. We love you, Endicott, such a special boy becoming such a special man. Anna and Bill Phillips",

Endi’s two dogs, Diego and Ozzie, were adopted from this no-kill shelter.Gifts to the Ironwood Pig Sanctuary, in Tucson, Arizona. Endi liked pigs.Gifts to Robinson High School Football Boosters.

The camp is doing many wonderful things to honor Endi’s memory, for which we are deeply grateful. And, for our part, we are going to pay for a child to go to camp, not only this year, but for at least the next 10 years. Because after most kids go to Echo Hill, they want to go back! You could contact the camp about their campership fund (those gifts are tax-deductible), or you could mail a check to the camp and put “Endicott Ackerman” in the subject line (those gifts are not tax-deductible, because we are keeping this fund separate).With love to all.

Such a turmoil time for you all, and your community surrounding you. We knew you through Clifton Elementary and St Clare church. Liz, I remember teaching a CCD class with you and Endicott came in after his class and I said to you he was a special kid, at glance, not even really knowing him. You wrapped your arms around him tightly and kissed him and said “ yes, he is my sweet one, so kind to others, I love him.” We both laughed and said we wished we had had one more kid, to add to our 4. We both loved a big family, and all the different personalities it brought.Endicott lived a full life, the one he was supposed to, the one HE enjoyed. As hard as it is to understand, God had that plan. We never understand why things happen, and especially why they happen to “ good people.” But all of you will be stronger for it, and will touch more people in their lives, then you will know. The letter from Hannah to her brother was so beautiful and moving that I will remember many aspects from that and live my life with those thoughts and actions. Endicotts life and death will be meaningful. And what an honor that is. While the pain of losing a child, brother, relative, friend, etc never leave, his impact of being in this world will forever be a positive and meaningful memory for so many.Be so proud your Son, and brother. He is obviously so well loved and thought of. I wish for you so much peace and comfort. We are so very sorry for your loss. In Sympathy, The Jasien family",

I hope you didn’t regret jumping for too long, or have to know for too long that you were about to die.I could tell that you found a lot of direction in the last few years. That’s something we have to do for ourselves, and I was impressed but not surprised. I hear you had big plans and were starting to really apply yourself. That makes me think you were happy before you died. I am so glad for that, because I believe we are “whatever room we are in.” I think you died a happy and confident and optimistic man. That is who you will always be to me, anyway.I am just so sorry that you didn’t get to try your hand at life, and learn more about the world, and see who you could be and what you could do. You know I always found you so great to be around – you were a sharp and independent thinker, and I thought your witty arrogance was totally charming. Most importantly, I think you always tried to be good to people. But I have learned so much more about you since you died, and it makes me wish I knew you better. I wish our friendship had been deeper. I wish we had done more things for each other. Maybe we postured too much, or maybe we just always relied on the other people in our lives. I wonder if you would feel the same way.Like Holden said in his eulogy, I want to be inspired by you. I want to rid myself of complacency, and never rely on other people for the initiative to do the things I want to do. This is how I will probably think about you most for the rest of my life.Mom, Dad, Holden, Simon, and I will all have to deal with your death for ourselves, and also as members of a family that lost you. Our family will always be incomplete. But we have been coming together, on a more emotional level than before. I know I took us for granted, and I don’t think I ever will again (I was even washing dishes and loading the dishwasher when I was home). I want so much for them to be okay, and in that desperate feeling, I feel my love for all of them so acutely. I think they are feeling that too, and I am optimistic that we have what it takes to stay as united as we were when you were still here.I know you regret jumping, but of course we can’t retrospectively separate excessive risk-taking from bad luck. You were who you were, and you loved what you loved. I guess I wish you were a little less arrogant. But not really. Mostly, I am so sorry for the bad luck, my brother.Love,Hannah",

Then you would go to that roadhouse, the place near Alice Springs, connect, and our phones would light up with lots of texts and pictures. Your dad and I would be so excited to hear from you.But for those days you didn’t text I would patiently wait. Then I decided that if I saw a majestic hawk soaring in the sky it must be a sign from you. You’d play along. I’d text: “Saw a hawk on Clifton Rd near Davis’ Store, was that u?” Some time would lapsed and then I’d get a “Yep.”So this weekend your dad, Simon and I went to the cabin. On Saturday, through tears, I planted the flower boxes on the back deck. The day was beautiful. Trinton’s Run was roaring and overflowing. Sunny, blue skies, big white clouds, cool breeze. All of a sudden this huge beautiful hawk comes swooshing down by the fire pit and begins to dance in the sky. I am the only audience. He flies low and then soars as far as my eye can follow. He comes back and circles and circles. I’m mesmerized for a good ten minutes watching him.  Your dad exits the front door and walks from the front porch to the shed and I yell from the side deck, “Look!” and it is gone. I like to think you sent him for me.Endi, my love for you is so strong. I have been graced to have you as my son and your spirit lives within me…..and I will always be in awe of you.

But it’s also testament to Endi.   To be sure, Endi was confident, sometimes to the point of cockiness. But it was playful. While he had strong opinions about almost everything, and he loved sharing them, he was also always thinking and learning and listening to others. I saw his tastes in many things change over time. He was growing, he was changing, he was getting better.   Thanks to Endi’s Aussie friends, and the stories they are sharing, we’re loving our son even more (if that’s possible). It makes the loss even harder, but the memories even sweeter, for he was a wonderful and dynamic person.   Finally, this note, just for fun. Endi’s first experience in Australia was not in Sydney but on a ranch in the middle of nowhere. He had limited Internet access so we’d wait for updates that arrived sporadically, and we’d send care packages as often as we could. While searching for Endi’s football highlights I found this email I had saved, from 2014. It is his requests for the next care package.

Heartbroken for Sam and Liz who give everything of themselves to their children and they deserved many many many more years with this wonderful child. Heartbroken for Hannah and Holden and Simon, he loved each of you so very dearly. And for his friends old and new and still unmade. There would have been so many more.We all wanted to be more like Endicott. When he walked into the room there was a sort of humming in the air: the energy of potential, for fun or competition or wit. He was generally fearless and made difficult things seem so easy. One of the last times we saw him, Sam and he had driven to Philly for a football tryout at UPenn. They stayed over, and at about 7 in the morning Endi was out in the driveway, in loafers, trying to prove to our son Django that he could dunk a basketball. I remember saying, “are you sure you want to be doing that? you don’t want to hurt yourself right before the tryout.” He just laughed and shrugged.Another time Lizzie and Endi met us for breakfast at a restaurant in Philly. We got there a bit before it opened and Django was getting a bit restless. Next thing we know Endi is running these insane foot races against Django from the restaurant down to the nearby train trestle and back, over and over - also at around 7 in the morning - just to keep him occupied.When Django was born, Endi was about 8 years old. From the very beginning he was crawling on the floor with Django, playing with him, singing to him. He was so incredibly caring and gentle. He just knew what to say, what to do. It was a very, very special relationship. When Django had to do a school project a few years ago about one of his heroes, he chose Endicott. I totally got that.People always tell kids they can be whatever they want when they grow up, and it’s the right thing to say even though it’s not true. With Endi it really was true - he could be president, or a movie star, or a football player, or a writer, or an inventor. It was just a matter of him choosing a path. I don’t know very much about life and when something like this happens I realize I know even less. But I know Endi is still on his path.much much much loveDon, Olja and Django",

Always running off exploring, always laughing, always drinking. I can’t even count the number of times Endo manipulated Duncan into attempting to out drink him.  Which always resulted in Duncan getting way too drunk… (sorry Dunc, but he could handle more than you). Aside from the drinking,  they did their monthly workout together, a 1km swim to Wedding Cake Island, which would always make me nervous. Sure enough, I got to deliver the “i told you so” when Endo returned with a nasty jellyfish sting around his waist (that he then flaunted due to it being across his abs..).  They enjoyed each other’s intelligence and were constantly challenging one another.  In a friendship way, they were soulmates. And had an incredible bond that others would envy. I feel so lucky to have witnessed their friendship.   Claudia Duncan and Endicott. St Johns Formal, Sydney 2016. ",

So fun-loving and energetic, always with a smile on your face. Not surprising, of course, since, in that way you managed to capture one of the best parts of your father. How fitting that you carried his first name as your middle name. My memories of you are mostly when you were younger, before the black hair that everyone has mentioned. Back when you were as tow-headed as your big brother and sister. I remember your dad coming up to pick me up when I was going to school in VA during spring break and going to see you all. Moving away from Delaware and up to NJ unfortunately also meant for me that I wouldn’t be able to see you (or the others as much), though I am now so glad for those fleeting of opportunities.However, through these messages, I realize what a detriment it was for me to miss seeing you grow up into the young man you became. Though, I like to think I got a small picture of him the last time I saw you in 2013 at Christmas time. Because the memory that evokes in me is a little different, though not far removed from the pictures that I have seen on here. The young man I met was one who had the utmost of patience for his young cousin, Jake. I saw you play with him and never losing patience or wanting to go out and do different more grown-up things. So, it surprised me not at all when I took a picture of all of you that he is perched at your side, snuggling against you. You reminded me so much of your father then and I like to think maybe that gave me a little bit of a sneak peek into the father you might have been. Which makes me cry and makes me proud of you all at the same time. The indelible picture I have of you in my head though is of you holding your youngest cousin, my daughter. There is a picture of you holding her and you looking down at her and her looking up at you, that gives me such a sense of loss and peace all at once. There is one job I have to do as a mother now and that is to hold her close and teach her about her cousin, Endicott. Though I sorely, sorely wish that you were around so that she could get to know you. You were in a class by yourself.I go to sleep now with the memories of your father singing the “Endicott” song to you when you were a child.My love goes out now not just to you and my memories of you, but always and forever, your father, my brother, Sam, Liz, your brothers, Holden and Simon and your sister, Hannah.Love Always,Your Aunt Sarah (and Cousin Gabrielle)",

You carried yourself with such confidence and a presence like no other. I called you Apricot because I couldn’t comprehend that your name was actually Endicott, but I should’ve known then that a special person like you deserved a special name. I now cherish the few times I got to spend with you including that late night trip to silver diner for milkshakes, that hour or two we spent talking in my car in a church parking lot, and that night you crashed my friends surprise party to hang out with me. I am already missing your smile and charm, you are so loved. This past week, I feel like I’ve reread every message and interaction between the two of us. I stumbled across my favorite one from one of my instagram posts, it reads “Don’t say anything now but just imagine how gorgeous our kids are going to be” It breaks my heart that no one got the chance to have you be their father because there is no doubt in my mind that you would’ve been a great one. And I would’ve been damn lucky too. I kept in frequent contact with Endi these past two years and in July will be studying abroad for a semester in Auckland, New Zealand. My first choice was Sydney, Endi being a huge factor in that but classes ended up not working and I settled on Auckland. Just two weeks ago, Endi and I were talking about him visiting Auckland during his winter break, something I was very much looking forward to. I will now carry his memory with me through my travels, and if i get the chance to visit Sydney, I’ll be sure to say a prayer for Endi and the entire Ackerman family. Much loveBrenna",

      "content"	 : "In the past few days I tried to remember how I met Endi for the first time. I thought it would have been this one day three years ago in June. I was walking through the hallway with my friends where he was standing with some other guys. He was leaning at a table so cool and relaxed like the star of some high school movie and was looking at me. Till today I don’t know what this look meant but it was so intense that my heart still beats faster when I think about this scene. I’m sure it wasn’t coincidence that we were there at the same time.But actually, that wasn’t the first time I met Endi. I already have met him earlier that week. It was a really hot day and we had English lessons when our teacher told us that during these lessons some American exchange students will come and tell us something about their lives in the US. I wasn’t one of the lucky students who were chosen to attend the exchange to the USA in the following October so I was really thrilled to got the chance to meet some of the Americans at least during their time here in Germany. I remember how he was standing in the front of the board looking at the class being so confident and relaxed while talking about him being from Fairfax, Virginia and playing football like he was used to give interviews every day. I think he had us all the minute he walked in. I have to admit that I was one of the girls who had a crush on him. But how could you resist? He was a charismatic, fascinating guy whose smile was contagious. Whenever he walked by people were looking at him. The girls adored and the guys admired him, watching every of his moves like they could learn something from him. Wherever I went during these days almost everybody talked about him. “This guy called Endicott. The football player from America”. I bet everybody knew about THIS SPECIAL GUY.Unfortunately, the time was short and he wasn’t around much so I never got the chance to get to know him better. But even though I only knew him briefly he touched my heart somehow. I always did and still do wish I’d known him better. When I found out about what happened I couldn’t believe it. I always told myself that this couldn’t be real. I may not have been one of his close friends but I never did or will forget about him. I’m still in shock and infinitely sad. Just some weeks ago when I saw a new picture of him popping up on Facebook I thought “maybe we will meet again some day”. And I’m sure we will. Maybe not now, maybe not so soon, but I’m sure we will…some day.My heart goes out to the Ackerman family and everyone who had known him. I can’t imagine what you feel right now and you have to deal with. I wish I’d be closer to you during this hard times.I’m sure I will never meet a person like him again. So incredibly special. He was a great guy.  Antonella Heidel, Dortmund/Germany",

      "content"	 : "So, posting all those photos was the easy part. This part, not so easy. We love this boy. Though we haven’t seen too much of him the last few years (but grateful and blessed to have seen him in our house this past Winter), for many years he was a part of our family. He was loyal and loving to our son, David, and it made a difference; a real honest to goodness difference, in David’s life. Before he had movie star good looks, he was just a scrawny, goofy kid with braces and boundless happy energy, who just happened to be smart as a whip, funny beyond his years, and intensely interesting. Most other kids would come over and we’d smile and say “Hi” and “you guys have a good time”. But with Endi, we’d sit down and speak with him, and we were better for it.He got my oh-so-subtle humor, which must have been a pleasant change for him. But seriously, it’s true. He had a superb brain, and was raised to view life as multi-dimensional and complex, and to question that which others blindly accepted. And this made him friggin’ interesting. And it means that those who knew him have questions, really poignant questions, that were we speaking of someone else, would simply not be so compelling; What would Endi have accomplished in his life? What would he have become? What would his ultimate passions have been? Who would his life partner have been? What kind of father would he have been, and what kind of kids would he have raised? And why; why why why did he jump in that water? Why? I guess knowing Endi, we do have some clues as to that answer, but I wish to God I’d had the opportunity to argue with him about it. To beg him not to, to tackle him and hold him down, to offer him money, a car, a vacation, ANYTHING to stay on those Goddamn rocks… to stay with us; with the so very many people who loved him and valued him and wanted to live in a world of which he was a part.",

      "content"	 : "If there was one thing about Endicott it was that there was no one else like him. He was a truly fascinating man. I always knew that if I was to sit down next to him in the dining hall and have a conversation with him over breakfast, lunch or dinner we would always have something interesting to talk about. Science, The Classics, Poetry or Sport Endicott always had an opinion about anything. More amusingly though, 95% of the time he thought his opinion was the right one! I remember joining in long, incredibly passionate arguments with Tom, Duncan, Henry or whoever cared to listen, and when it was Endicott’s turn to speak he never shied away from the spotlight. I remember him recounting his heroics in the Fresher Footy (Rugby) match, a sport Endicott had never played before. After getting into a fight on the field he explained how he single handedly had fought off four, five, six !? opponents - “Man I was just knocking them down, I had one in my right hand and I was smacking him, I’ve got a bust lip, but I’m still whacking this guy with my left !”.Endicott was always copping flack for the fact that he had a pretty good rig (aka. body). Every event at Johns people would take odds on the likelihood that Endicott would remove his shirt at some point at an event. Though this banter only played right into Endicott’s ego, I remember someone yelling at Endicott once in the corridor “Put a shirt on!”, for Endicott to only turn straight around lift up his shirt, with a big cheesy grin and say “You’re just jealous, see you could grate cheese on these abs!”. No one made the most of their new life in Sydney like Endicott did. Rain, hail or shine every weekend when everyone else was nursing bad hangovers or feeling sorry for themselves Duncan, Endicott and Claude would troop off to the beach to make the most of the day. And in the night they’d do the exact same, venturing out to meet all sorts of new people, seeking out the latest or coolest night spots for some fun. I like this photo because I think it captures Endicotts thirst for adventure and the fun times we had together. Although we weren’t best mates I always knew that anytime with Endicott was going to be a good one, no matter the event or time we’d pick up exactly where we left off.

I know our move to Richmond, put space between the boys, but when each of them recall their childhoods, they will remember each other.     Endi grew from the soft-hearted boy into a smart, strong and handsome young man, with the same soft heart. He will always be 10 years old in my mind…. his short black hair, and the teeth he needed to grow into (and did - SOOO HANDSOME) Endi spread joy and his carefree ways everywhere he went.
