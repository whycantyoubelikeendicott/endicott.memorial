		<p>Oh Endi. Every day without you is so painful, almost more than I can bear. So when I tell you that today is the worst day in a long time, that should really tell you something. Since you can’t be here with me, I thought I’d write you a letter.</p>

<p>We took your brother Simon to college yesterday. The University of Pittsburgh, but you know that. He’s an amazing young man, and you deserve a lot of the credit for how great he is. I never like to compare Simon to you too much, because he deserves to be his own person (and he is), but I also know that you loved having a younger brother and you saw in him an opportunity to shape him and make him (almost) as cool and confident as you. You succeeded. He’s going to thrive, and you’ll always be a part of him.</p>

<p>When you were little, remember, people said you and Holden were like twins. Always together, and him always looking out for you. Then, as you got older, you went in your own directions (as it should be), and I think you felt that in many ways you were very different from Holden. But when you learn that he is in Senegal, in the Peace Corps, helping others, you see just how similar you two have always been. Same spirit of adventure, same sense of no boundaries, same desire to make the world a better place, same confidence and big heart.</p>

<p>Hannah, your rival and beloved big sister, is a lawyer in New Hampshire (but you know that, too). She, too, is helping others as a public defender. As much as you loved to complete with Hannah, I know you must be very proud to see the good that she is doing. You, too, have always had a powerful sense of justice.</p>

<p>I am so proud of all of them. And I am proud of you, too, Endi. What a truly incredible young man. What a wonderful son to have had in my life.</p>

<p>The day before we took Simon to college, he rolled into the driveway in his Jeep with the windows rolled down and the music loud. Just like you used to. At the time it made me smile (the truth is I think about you and smile all the time, because of your sheer awesomeness). But now I am remembering that, and I am crying. I want you to be here with us so much. Right now, by my side, where you are supposed to be.</p>

<p>Endi, I love you. More than these words or any can ever say. Love, Father. August 22, 2018</p>
