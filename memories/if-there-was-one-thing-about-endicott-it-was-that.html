<p>If there was one thing about Endicott it was that there was no one else like him. He was a truly fascinating man. I always knew that if I was to sit down next to him in the dining hall and have a conversation with him over breakfast, lunch or dinner we would always have something interesting to talk about. Science, The Classics, Poetry or Sport Endicott always had an opinion about anything. More amusingly though, 95% of the time he thought his opinion was the right one! I remember joining in long, incredibly passionate arguments with Tom, Duncan, Henry or whoever cared to listen, and when it was Endicott’s turn to speak he never shied away from the spotlight. I remember him recounting his heroics in the Fresher Footy (Rugby) match, a sport Endicott had never played before. After getting into a fight on the field he explained how he single handedly had fought off four, five, six !? opponents - “Man I was just knocking them down, I had one in my right hand and I was smacking him, I’ve got a bust lip, but I’m still whacking this guy with my left !”.</p>

<p>Endicott was always copping flack for the fact that he had a pretty good rig (aka. body). Every event at Johns people would take odds on the likelihood that Endicott would remove his shirt at some point at an event. Though this banter only played right into Endicott’s ego, I remember someone yelling at Endicott once in the corridor “Put a shirt on!”, for Endicott to only turn straight around lift up his shirt, with a big cheesy grin and say “You’re just jealous, see you could grate cheese on these abs!”. </p>

<p>No one made the most of their new life in Sydney like Endicott did. Rain, hail or shine every weekend when everyone else was nursing bad hangovers or feeling sorry for themselves Duncan, Endicott and Claude would troop off to the beach to make the most of the day. And in the night they’d do the exact same, venturing out to meet all sorts of new people, seeking out the latest or coolest night spots for some fun. </p>

<p>I like this photo because I think it captures Endicotts thirst for adventure and the fun times we had together. Although we weren’t best mates I always knew that anytime with Endicott was going to be a good one, no matter the event or time we’d pick up exactly where we left off. Ready to seek out some new form of mischief or try out some new idea. </p>
