		<p>Endi,</p>

<p>There is no way to tell you how sorry I am that this happened to you. I hope you weren’t afraid for too long. I hope you didn’t regret jumping for too long, or have to know for too long that you were about to die.</p>

<p>I could tell that you found a lot of direction in the last few years. That’s something we have to do for ourselves, and I was impressed but not surprised. I hear you had big plans and were starting to really apply yourself. That makes me think you were happy before you died. I am so glad for that, because I believe we are “whatever room we are in.” I think you died a happy and confident and optimistic man. That is who you will always be to me, anyway.</p>

<p>I am just so sorry that you didn’t get to try your hand at life, and learn more about the world, and see who you could be and what you could do. You know I always found you so great to be around – you were a sharp and independent thinker, and I thought your witty arrogance was totally charming. Most importantly, I think you always tried to be good to people. But I have learned so much more about you since you died, and it makes me wish I knew you better. I wish our friendship had been deeper. I wish we had done more things for each other. Maybe we postured too much, or maybe we just always relied on the other people in our lives. I wonder if you would feel the same way.</p>

<p>Like Holden said in his eulogy, I want to be inspired by you. I want to rid myself of complacency, and never rely on other people for the initiative to do the things I want to do. This is how I will probably think about you most for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Mom, Dad, Holden, Simon, and I will all have to deal with your death for ourselves, and also as members of a family that lost you. Our family will always be incomplete. But we have been coming together, on a more emotional level than before. I know I took us for granted, and I don’t think I ever will again (I was even washing dishes and loading the dishwasher when I was home). I want so much for them to be okay, and in that desperate feeling, I feel my love for all of them so acutely. I think they are feeling that too, and I am optimistic that we have what it takes to stay as united as we were when you were still here.</p>

<p>I know you regret jumping, but of course we can’t retrospectively separate excessive risk-taking from bad luck. You were who you were, and you loved what you loved. I guess I wish you were a little less arrogant. But not really. Mostly, I am so sorry for the bad luck, my brother.</p>

<p>Love,<br />
Hannah</p>
