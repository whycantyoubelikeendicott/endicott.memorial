		<p>We are heartbroken for the world because Endi had so much to share that he won’t get a chance to share. Heartbroken for Sam and Liz who give everything of themselves to their children and they deserved many many many more years with this wonderful child. Heartbroken for Hannah and Holden and Simon, he loved each of you so very dearly. And for his friends old and new and still unmade. There would have been so many more.</p>

<p>We all wanted to be more like Endicott. When he walked into the room there was a sort of humming in the air: the energy of potential, for fun or competition or wit. He was generally fearless and made difficult things seem so easy. One of the last times we saw him, Sam and he had driven to Philly for a football tryout at UPenn. They stayed over, and at about 7 in the morning Endi was out in the driveway, in loafers, trying to prove to our son Django that he could dunk a basketball. I remember saying, “are you sure you want to be doing that? you don’t want to hurt yourself right before the tryout.” He just laughed and shrugged.</p>

<p>Another time Lizzie and Endi met us for breakfast at a restaurant in Philly. We got there a bit before it opened and Django was getting a bit restless. Next thing we know Endi is running these insane foot races against Django from the restaurant down to the nearby train trestle and back, over and over - also at around 7 in the morning - just to keep him occupied.</p>

<p>When Django was born, Endi was about 8 years old. From the very beginning he was crawling on the floor with Django, playing with him, singing to him. He was so incredibly caring and gentle. He just knew what to say, what to do. It was a very, very special relationship. When Django had to do a school project a few years ago about one of his heroes, he chose Endicott. I totally got that.</p>

<p>People always tell kids they can be whatever they want when they grow up, and it’s the right thing to say even though it’s not true. With Endi it really was true - he could be president, or a movie star, or a football player, or a writer, or an inventor. It was just a matter of him choosing a path. I don’t know very much about life and when something like this happens I realize I know even less. But I know Endi is still on his path.</p>

<p>much much much love</p>

<p>Don, Olja and Django</p>
