				<p>A number of people have asked about gifts that could be made in Endi’s (Endo’s) honor.</p>

<p>For Liz, Hannah, Holden, Simon and me, the greatest gift you could give us would be to continue to love and remember our son. That is all we ask.</p>

<p>(And don’t forget the tattoo, and/or the middle name for your first-born child.)</p>

<p>That said, the family is making four gifts as ways of honoring Endi, and we would be happy to see anyone else do the same, as they are all good causes.</p>

<p>Gifts to Friends of Homeless Animals, in Aldie, Virginia. Endi’s two dogs, Diego and Ozzie, were adopted from this no-kill shelter.</p>

<p>Gifts to the Ironwood Pig Sanctuary, in Tucson, Arizona. Endi liked pigs.</p>

<p>Gifts to Robinson High School Football Boosters. As everyone knows, football was a huge part of Endi’s life.</p>

<p>Gifts to Echo Hill Camp, in Worton, Maryland. This is a place Endi loved very much. The camp is doing many wonderful things to honor Endi’s memory, for which we are deeply grateful. And, for our part, we are going to pay for a child to go to camp, not only this year, but for at least the next 10 years. Because after most kids go to Echo Hill, they want to go back! You could contact the camp about their campership fund (those gifts are tax-deductible), or you could mail a check to the camp and put “Endicott Ackerman” in the subject line (those gifts are not tax-deductible, because we are keeping this fund separate).</p>

<p>With love to all. Sam / Liz</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p>And for a brief moment, the world stood still.  That stillness was a symbol to us that Endi had left this world, and had now embarked on a new journey to a world beyond.  Endi’s energy left his body on June 6, 2016, but what remains is his spirit, which is with us all.</p>

<p>In a lifetime, we come in contact with countless people, make acquaintances with a great many of those, and become friends with a few.  In Endi, he touched many people, and now those of us who count him as a friend, are here, yes, to mourn our loss, but more importantly, to celebrate his life.  We celebrate by remembering all that he gave to those he loved, and the world around him.  We celebrate the many kind deeds he performed and the many lives he touched, in even the simplest of ways.</p>

<p>To celebrate Endi’s life, please take a brief moment, to reflect on those remembrances, whispering from the past.  Wherever you may be, light a small candle, meditate, or cast the petals of a favorite flower to the wind in Endi’s memory.</p>

<p>Endi, know that you will be missed by all you loved, and by those who loved you, but you will never be forgotten.  The beautiful memories which you left in all of us will live on forever, and ever, and ever …</p>

<p>May the peace of the Lord be with you always.</p>

				<p>Oh my sweet Lizzie,</p>

<p>I’m so very sorry for your loss. I remember we were both pregnant with our third babies (Endi and Andrew) around the same time while we were at TU. I was always impressed with how much you adored and admired your children. You’re a wonderful mom and all of your kids are lucky to have you (and Sam too!). Know that I’ve thought about you every day since I head the sad news about Endi. You and your family will continue to be in my prayers.  Love and hugs to you all. </p>

<p>It was the end of the day &amp; I was walking to my car and I found a note on the windshield that said “Hey Sara! There’s a surprise in your trunk!” I opened my trunk to some balloons, andsign that said “homecoming?” With two stick figures (one drawn very tall to illustrate our obvious size difference). I waited and nothing actually happened for a couple minutes until Endi popped out with flowers to ask me to homecoming. Not only Endi but his mother showed me the best homecoming.</p>

<p>I have always admired Endicott’s strong sense of self, he was smart and he knew it (always correcting people’s grammar) but you could never be mad because he was so undoubtably him. He is one of a kind and the world is dimmer without him.</p>
