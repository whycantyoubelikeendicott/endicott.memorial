<p>My dear Endicott,</p>

<p>This June 6 2017, is a date I have been dreading. How I wish I could go back in time and hold that young boy seen here on his first day of kindergarten. If only time could stand still.<br />
Not a moment goes by without my heart aching for you.</p>

<p>I love you. Mom</p>

<p>My Endi,</p>

<p>This Mother’s Day was warm with the love of your dad, siblings, family and friends but there was one certain love missing …from my “Aussie Endi.”</p>

<p>We released five butterflies in your memory w one released at the goal posts near the Oasis and several off the deck near your outdoor shower and the sauna which have sat dormant since your last use.</p>

<p>My love for you will always be never-ending. You are a joy.</p>

<p>My dear Endi,</p>

<p>Today, March 22, is our one year anniversary where you and I enjoyed “The Barber of Seville” at the Sydney Opera House. We dined at a lovely restaurant in the Rocks neighborhood and walked to the Opera House. I surprised you with orchestra pit tickets. Where you sat you had plenty of leg room and could almost touch the magnificent curtain. You were full of life that evening and would grin every time a familiar song would play. I’d close my eyes and think of a little Holden and a little Endi watching Bugs Bunny and singing “…you’re so next..”</p>

<p>I love you, my dear child. I miss you terribly my love, my angel.</p>

<p>Mom</p>

				<p>I think about you every day, Endi. And I miss you so much.</p>

<p>The time I spent with you was an adventure and not one second was wasted. I remember the first time I met you very well. It was in 2012, at Washington Airport and I just got there from Germany, very nervous about meeting my host family. You came up to me with your big smile, you were very excited and handed me a super corny ‘I LOVE YOU’ balloon. From that point, I knew you were a joker and that we would have a good time!</p>

<p>The next year you came to Germany, and I am still so thankful you went and joined my Football Team during your stay. We had just transferred to the highest Youth American Football League in Germany and it was a close fight for staying in the league. You joined the practice, and the other kids including me just didn’t stand a chance when going against you in drills. Eventually, I stood on the field with you in the final game of the season. I’m happy to be able to say that. It was a great honor. The impact you made on that game was unbelievable. You played as a tight end and defensive end - to you it was business as usual. We were on offense and I remember rolling out and throwing you a terribly high pass on your out-route. Instead of letting it pass, you gave it all, jumped what felt like three meters high and made a spectacular one-handed grab. At the latest from then on everybody in the entire club knew who the ‘American kid’ was. We won the game and it was very close, it was like a movie. You helped save my team from going back to League 2 and the coach likes to reminisce on that day. He always says if it wasn’t for you, we wouldn’t have made it and I agree. The team went on evolving and reached the Juniorbowl in 2015, two years later. It was so beautiful. You helped a big bunch of kids make incredible memories there, that they will remember for a lifetime. The coach and the entire team send their condolences to the Ackerman family. Endi, you have left your mark here and everyone on the team remembers you very well and loves you!</p>

<p>I had the privilege to come visit you and your lovely family again in 2014. It was one of the most exciting summers I ever had. I learned a lot from you during that time. You were a winner. I could tell by the way you turned off your phone after losing a game of ‘connect four’ on it, the way you focused when laying table tennis and the way you tackled your workouts: The Endi way. If you were in it, you were in it for 100% and you were in it to win. You made me strive to become a winner, too. You showed me how to eat right for building up muscle, which is Chipotle every day for those who don’t know. I remember how we used to sneak out of your parents’ house through the roof at night to go meet friends. I thought it was fantastic. Really, every day spent with you was an adventure.</p>

<p>I always wanted you to come visit me in Germany or in England this past year, but it just didn’t work out. I just wish we could have sat at the fireplace one more time and talk about the memories we made together and share what we are up to. I would have loved to see what kind of man you have become. I am 1000% sure you would have been someone people love to be around, because you were generous, funny, a leader with a lot of energy and an inspiring human being.</p>

<p>I have always heard that people live on in our memories. I think what’s even better is to let you live on in my deeds.</p>

<p>I want to be brave, confident, loving and give life my all, just like you.</p>

<p>I love you Endi.</p>

<p>And I love you so much, Mr. and Mrs. Ackerman. Thank you for making it possible, that your son and I became friends. There is so much love in your family and I feel blessed to have lived with you. For so long I didn’t know what to say to you in those dark times but now I know: I love you, and also Holden, Hannah and my little tall buddy Simon, who has probably grown so much. I miss you all.</p>
