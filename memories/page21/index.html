<p>If there was one thing about Endicott it was that there was no one else like him. He was a truly fascinating man. I always knew that if I was to sit down next to him in the dining hall and have a conversation with him over breakfast, lunch or dinner we would always have something interesting to talk about. Science, The Classics, Poetry or Sport Endicott always had an opinion about anything. More amusingly though, 95% of the time he thought his opinion was the right one! I remember joining in long, incredibly passionate arguments with Tom, Duncan, Henry or whoever cared to listen, and when it was Endicott’s turn to speak he never shied away from the spotlight. I remember him recounting his heroics in the Fresher Footy (Rugby) match, a sport Endicott had never played before. After getting into a fight on the field he explained how he single handedly had fought off four, five, six !? opponents - “Man I was just knocking them down, I had one in my right hand and I was smacking him, I’ve got a bust lip, but I’m still whacking this guy with my left !”.</p>

<p>Endicott was always copping flack for the fact that he had a pretty good rig (aka. body). Every event at Johns people would take odds on the likelihood that Endicott would remove his shirt at some point at an event. Though this banter only played right into Endicott’s ego, I remember someone yelling at Endicott once in the corridor “Put a shirt on!”, for Endicott to only turn straight around lift up his shirt, with a big cheesy grin and say “You’re just jealous, see you could grate cheese on these abs!”. </p>

<p>No one made the most of their new life in Sydney like Endicott did. Rain, hail or shine every weekend when everyone else was nursing bad hangovers or feeling sorry for themselves Duncan, Endicott and Claude would troop off to the beach to make the most of the day. And in the night they’d do the exact same, venturing out to meet all sorts of new people, seeking out the latest or coolest night spots for some fun. </p>

<p>I like this photo because I think it captures Endicotts thirst for adventure and the fun times we had together. Although we weren’t best mates I always knew that anytime with Endicott was going to be a good one, no matter the event or time we’d pick up exactly where we left off. Ready to seek out some new form of mischief or try out some new idea. </p>

<p>I have sooo many photos of you to choose from and I had the best pic of us that really summed up our relationship but it may be a bit inappropriate so I opted for a nicer one. This is one of the many fond memories I was able to capture and keep.</p>

<p>Endo you taught me so much and I thank you for the lessons I’ve gained from fortunately knowing you and becoming so close to you within the past year. There are so many things that I would like to say to you but for now I choose to say sorry. Wherever you are I hope you accept my sincerest apology and just know how much I loved and cared for you.</p>

<p>I will say what you used to say to me every night before bed for the last time, although it hurts and I miss you I hope you ‘sleep tight’ Endo. </p>

				<p>Dear Endi,  </p>

<p>I remember the days when we were kids playing outside in our backyards together in our pools and hot tubs, drinking root beers out of the bottles your dad always got in your basement with your brothers  I think it was called “ birch beer” hahaha that’s was great. I remember the times your mom would make amazing snacks for us after school when we were hungry :) and the car rides to the general store in your dads old school apache 3 speed on the tree on the weekends. But most of all I remember how you always seemed to make people laugh and gather around you. There was always something about you that no one else had. Always so adventurous and ready to get out and go do something at a moments notice. I’m sitting here trying not to ball my eyes but I think everyone’s already doing that and so am i… the world lost a great friend, adventurer, and loving son. My heart goes out to the Ackerman family. I know we never got to hang out much ever since I moved and graduated but I was looking forward to seeing you again one day to have a couple drinks or hell smoke a cigar together but that will have to wait for now. Until we meet again Endi. </p>

<p>Sincerely with all my heart and soul,</p>

<p>Arthur Thompson</p>

<p>This photo was taken in summer 2015. Duncan, Endo and I had spent the evening drinking at my Mums apartment. Of course, in Endo’s company, Amy Winehouse and other classics were played on repeat. We suddenly realised we had run out of time. The last train to Bondi Junction (on route to, Endo’s favourite club, El Topo) was 10 minutes away. This photo was taken straight after we had sprinted to the station. Can’t actually remember if we had made in time.  -  Claudia </p>
