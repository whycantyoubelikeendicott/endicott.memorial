		<p>So, posting all those photos was the easy part. This part, not so easy. We love this boy. Though we haven’t seen too much of him the last few years (but grateful and blessed to have seen him in our house this past Winter), for many years he was a part of our family. He was loyal and loving to our son, David, and it made a difference; a real honest to goodness difference, in David’s life. Before he had movie star good looks, he was just a scrawny, goofy kid with braces and boundless happy energy, who just happened to be smart as a whip, funny beyond his years, and intensely interesting. Most other kids would come over and we’d smile and say “Hi” and “you guys have a good time”. But with Endi, we’d sit down and speak with him, and we were better for it.</p>

<p>He got my oh-so-subtle humor, which must have been a pleasant change for him. But seriously, it’s true. He had a superb brain, and was raised to view life as multi-dimensional and complex, and to question that which others blindly accepted. And this made him friggin’ interesting. And it means that those who knew him have questions, really poignant questions, that were we speaking of someone else, would simply not be so compelling; What would Endi have accomplished in his life? What would he have become? What would his ultimate passions have been? Who would his life partner have been? What kind of father would he have been, and what kind of kids would he have raised? And why; why why why did he jump in that water? Why? I guess knowing Endi, we do have some clues as to that answer, but I wish to God I’d had the opportunity to argue with him about it. To beg him not to, to tackle him and hold him down, to offer him money, a car, a vacation, ANYTHING to stay on those Goddamn rocks… to stay with us; with the so very many people who loved him and valued him and wanted to live in a world of which he was a part.</p>
