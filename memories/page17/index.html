<p>Endicott was my godson.  I was only a freshman in high school when he was baptized and remember thinking what an honor it was to be chosen by my Aunt Liz (my godmother) and Uncle Sam to be a part of this beautiful baby’s life!  This picture is of me dressing him before the ceremony.  I did not get to spend much time with Endicott throughout his far too short time on this world, but I thought of him often and was always in wonder of his spirit and his love of life.  The last time I saw Endicott in person was at my wedding in 2011.  He had grown into such a handsome young man!  I loved his warm smile and his easy way with conversation, and I had looked forward to a time where we could sit and talk for awhile.  I still look forward to spending that time with him, it will just have to wait for now.  Love you, Endi.     </p>

<p>Endi. We knew all of your life. Not as well as many, but on those fun occasions when we were together with you, your parents and siblings, we found you courteous, respectful and never ill toward anyone. A gentleman. Your confident and impish (at times mischievous) sense of humor always made us laugh. And the thought of you always makes us smile. Peace and love be with you always, our friend. - Frank + Kelli</p>

<p>I don’t know if Duncan will post on here in his own words but I wanted to share my view of their friendship. </p>

<p>Duncan and Endo had a friendship like no other.  From the moment they met they were inseparable. Always running off exploring, always laughing, always drinking. I can’t even count the number of times Endo manipulated Duncan into attempting to out drink him.  Which always resulted in Duncan getting way too drunk… (sorry Dunc, but he could handle more than you). Aside from the drinking,  they did their monthly workout together, a 1km swim to Wedding Cake Island, which would always make me nervous. Sure enough, I got to deliver the “i told you so” when Endo returned with a nasty jellyfish sting around his waist (that he then flaunted due to it being across his abs..).  They enjoyed each other’s intelligence and were constantly challenging one another.  In a friendship way, they were soulmates. And had an incredible bond that others would envy. <br />
I feel so lucky to have witnessed their friendship. </p>

<p>Endo and I in our 2nd week in Sydney, of course, at Bondi Beach. <br />
This was the first time Endo, Duncan and I had gone exploring round the eastern beaches (we did this almost every sunny weekend) . <br />
They went mad, climbing over everything, following the unstable rocks north of the beach… I could barely keep up. <br />
I remember feeling completely content with my crazy new friends but I would never of guessed how close us 3 would truely become.</p>

				<p>Endi, I was able to sit down with Mama Bear today for the first time. We talked about how you and I met. You were in 4th grade at the time. Holden and my son were together on the same SYC football team. I remember allot about your “do’s” and “dont’s”. I remember showing you how bad I was at shooting the basketball in your driveway. I remember playing pass and catch in your back yard, I remember your extra credit work helping with the outdoor shower we built. And I remember tattling on you to your Dad about the beer party you had when they were away. I have watched most of Sam and Liz’s children grow up and the entire family always treated me as a good friend. I will miss that smile, but will you say hello to my mom and and enjoy her memories of me as I will of her and you.</p>
