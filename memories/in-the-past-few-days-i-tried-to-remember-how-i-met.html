<p>In the past few days I tried to remember how I met Endi for the first time. I thought it would have been this one day three years ago in June. I was walking through the hallway with my friends where he was standing with some other guys. He was leaning at a table so cool and relaxed like the star of some high school movie and was looking at me. Till today I don’t know what this look meant but it was so intense that my heart still beats faster when I think about this scene. I’m sure it wasn’t coincidence that we were there at the same time.<br />
But actually, that wasn’t the first time I met Endi. I already have met him earlier that week. It was a really hot day and we had English lessons when our teacher told us that during these lessons some American exchange students will come and tell us something about their lives in the US. I wasn’t one of the lucky students who were chosen to attend the exchange to the USA in the following October so I was really thrilled to got the chance to meet some of the Americans at least during their time here in Germany. I remember how he was standing in the front of the board looking at the class being so confident and relaxed while talking about him being from Fairfax, Virginia and playing football like he was used to give interviews every day. <br />
I think he had us all the minute he walked in. I have to admit that I was one of the girls who had a crush on him. But how could you resist? He was a charismatic, fascinating guy whose smile was contagious. Whenever he walked by people were looking at him. The girls adored and the guys admired him, watching every of his moves like they could learn something from him. Wherever I went during these days almost everybody talked about him. “This guy called Endicott. The football player from America”. I bet everybody knew about THIS SPECIAL GUY.<br />
Unfortunately, the time was short and he wasn’t around much so I never got the chance to get to know him better. <br />
But even though I only knew him briefly he touched my heart somehow. I always did and still do wish I’d known him better. <br />
When I found out about what happened I couldn’t believe it. I always told myself that this couldn’t be real. I may not have been one of his close friends but I never did or will forget about him. I’m still in shock and infinitely sad. <br />
Just some weeks ago when I saw a new picture of him popping up on Facebook I thought “maybe we will meet again some day”. And I’m sure we will. Maybe not now, maybe not so soon, but I’m sure we will…some day.</p>

<p>My heart goes out to the Ackerman family and everyone who had known him. I can’t imagine what you feel right now and you have to deal with. I wish I’d be closer to you during this hard times.</p>

<p>I’m sure I will never meet a person like him again. So incredibly special. He was a great guy.</p>
