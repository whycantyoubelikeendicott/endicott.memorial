<p>We met each other in 7th grade and I gave you my number a few weeks later. One night we stayed up texting very late talking about how lame the middle school dances were and how we never attended one. I told you that the only dance I’d consider going to would be prom senior year. You promised that night you would be my date no matter what. I didn’t take it that seriously because no one could know where we’d be 5 years into the future… until the spring time of senior year quickly came and I asked if you remembered the silly 7th grade text promise. You did, you weren’t one to forget things. One day at the gym while you were stretching and I was pretending to do sit-ups next to you, you asked me what my favorite type of flower was and I said Stargazer Lily’s. Sure enough, the next morning you took off your shirt to make sure everyone knew your chiseled abs hadn’t gone anywhere, and you walked up to me at my locker with a poster saying “I ABSolutely hope you say yes to prom” and a bouquet of Stargazer Lily’s. I was so incredibly excited because a dream guy and an amazing person that any girl would have been ecstatic to go to prom with asked me. You didn’t forget or break your promise. A few minutes later as I was trying to keep my blushing under control and all the girls around us were staring with hearts in their eyes you were whistled at by an admin member and told to put your shirt back on. Which you did, very slowly, with the most perfect Endicott smile on your face.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p>Growing up in the neighborhood that I did I had one friend my age, Kevin Graine, and when I heard that a new family was moving in I was ecstatic to say the least especially when I heard that they had four children. When Endi first moved in I remember our first encounter being an awkward one to say the least just trying to get a feel for what the other person was like. However I knew then and there I would have a friend for life. Endi, Simon, Holden, and I would do anything possible in the small town we lived in, anything ranging from hiking in the woods, to walking to the Clifton store for soda and candy or making a raving talk show to uploading to YouTube staring a spunky meatball shaped stuffed animal of Endi’s. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/StingoFeelTheSting">https://www.youtube.com/user/StingoFeelTheSting</a> you can view all the wonderful episodes here). Endi was an inspiration to me growing up he was everything I wanted to be, strong, kind, athletic,funny, smart, and a plethora of other  great qualities. I looked up to him so much weather he knew that or not he was what drove me to do better in school and better myself as a person and I have great relief knowing that Endi has not just blessed me, but many others around the world with his wit, knowledge and all around fanatic character. Not a day goes by where I don’t think about Endi and one thing I think about most is that I wish we would have talked more. When I moved in 5th grade we kept up contact somewhat but as life got busier and schedules became more packed I found myself not reaching out as much and this is the one thing I regret more than anything was thinking that I had more time. I would give anything to talk to Endi again. The last conversation I remember having with him was because I was having trouble remembering the name of Archers ringtone (Archer was one of Endis favorite shows) and withing 5 minutes of me asking I had a reply form him telling me exactly the name bringing an instant smile to my face. I miss you Endi and I wanted to say thank you for all that you have taught me. </p>

<p>Also, Thank you to the Ackerman family. I remember countless dinners and sleepovers at your house. Playing Xbox in the basement, the arcade machine, air hockey table, fooseball,. and ping pong. Swimming in your ool (notice how there’s no P in it, they liked to keep it that way). Memories like these I will hold forever and cherish for a lifetime. I’m so sorry for your loss and Mr. Sam, I’d like to take you up on that offer. I think I have a great middle name for my first son.</p>

<p>Love and Warm Regards,</p>

<p>Andrew Farlow </p>

				<p>Some of our favorite memories of Endi are from Flag Football. The first photo of Endi and Charlie is from their first year playing flag football (8th grade?) It is also the last time they were on different teams. After that, working with Sam, they came up with complicated strategies to work the system (like the optimal picking order and intentionally performing poorly at try-outs) so that they would always play together. Or rather, they <u>informed</u> Coach Sam of the strategy needed to get the right group of players on the team. Flag football was a much more relaxed game with minimal practices and simpler uniforms. But Endi was never particularly relaxed about playing hard, always playing intensely but really having fun. The last two years of high school, Endi and Charlie also coached Simon’s team and truly reveled in employing some of the same strategies to form this team and figuring out plays to surprise their opponents.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>We love you, Endicott, such a special boy becoming such a special man.</p>
