		<p>Endi-</p>

<p>Bear with me because I am writing this at 1:47 in the AM.</p>

<p>I am here now at your Grandma Nancy’s house with all these pictures of you around me, reminding me, though I did not need that, of the child you were. So fun-loving and energetic, always with a smile on your face. Not surprising, of course, since, in that way you managed to capture one of the best parts of your father. How fitting that you carried his first name as your middle name. My memories of you are mostly when you were younger, before the black hair that everyone has mentioned. Back when you were as tow-headed as your big brother and sister. I remember your dad coming up to pick me up when I was going to school in VA during spring break and going to see you all. Moving away from Delaware and up to NJ unfortunately also meant for me that I wouldn’t be able to see you (or the others as much), though I am now so glad for those fleeting of opportunities.</p>

<p>However, through these messages, I realize what a detriment it was for me to miss seeing you grow up into the young man you became. Though, I like to think I got a small picture of him the last time I saw you in 2013 at Christmas time. Because the memory that evokes in me is a little different, though not far removed from the pictures that I have seen on here. The young man I met was one who had the utmost of patience for his young cousin, Jake. I saw you play with him and never losing patience or wanting to go out and do different more grown-up things. So, it surprised me not at all when I took a picture of all of you that he is perched at your side, snuggling against you. You reminded me so much of your father then and I like to think maybe that gave me a little bit of a sneak peek into the father you might have been. Which makes me cry and makes me proud of you all at the same time. The indelible picture I have of you in my head though is of you holding your youngest cousin, my daughter. There is a picture of you holding her and you looking down at her and her looking up at you, that gives me such a sense of loss and peace all at once. There is one job I have to do as a mother now and that is to hold her close and teach her about her cousin, Endicott. Though I sorely, sorely wish that you were around so that she could get to know you. You were in a class by yourself.</p>

<p>I go to sleep now with the memories of your father singing the “Endicott” song to you when you were a child.</p>

<p>My love goes out now not just to you and my memories of you, but always and forever, your father, my brother, Sam, Liz, your brothers, Holden and Simon and your sister, Hannah.</p>

<p>Love Always,<br />
Your Aunt Sarah (and Cousin Gabrielle)</p>
