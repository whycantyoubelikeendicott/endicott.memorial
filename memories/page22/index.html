<p>This picture I found of you on my Twitter account speaks for itself. You were fearless, ambitious, and simply just Endi. The last words you’ve said to me a couple weeks ago was “I have no complaints” (referring to your life and adventures so far). It inspires me that you found exactly who you were meant to be in life. It gives me comfort that you were content and happy. Much love. <br />
Your friend, Rachel Kim</p>

			</div>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p>They say….. You can always tell where a person has been by the tears and the smiles left behind.   Endi was loved and admired by ALL who knew him.   I know there are MANY tears now, but I am praying that with time… memories will bring a smile to you.  We were so blessed to have Endi in our lives while living in Clifton.  He and Holden were Honorary Farlows.  So many good times shared with the boys, just being boys.  From pool hopping, to sledding the hill, eating snow cream, to going to OBX and driving seaways, Lip Syncing to Queen (Bohemian Rhapsody), The fire pit at your house, the hot tub at our house, the endless hours on the rope swing, Clifton store, Day trips to Baltimore Science Museum, Four-wheeling at the Paris house, to making origami in Richmond.  Endi was a DELIGHT, and oh so smart!  He was such a good friend to Andrew. I know our move to Richmond, put space between the boys, but when each of them recall their childhoods, they will remember each other.     Endi grew from the soft-hearted boy into a smart, strong and handsome young man, with the same soft heart. He will always be 10 years old in my mind…. his short black hair, and the teeth he needed to grow into (and did - SOOO HANDSOME) Endi spread joy and his carefree ways everywhere he went. He will always be in my heart.  HE LIVED LIFE LARGE.  The world is a better place because Endicott was in it.  One never knows what a day will bring… Our loss is heaven’s gain.  Rest in Peace Endi - You are loved.   </p>

<p>Oh Endi   </p>

<p>From the moment you were born you challenged us. You inspired us. You made us laugh. You gave your love. And you were always deeply loved, every day of your life.   </p>

<p>I was reflecting on how, in leaving us, you have left people crying on three continents. It makes me think about all the many more lives you could have touched all over the world – the places you would have gone, the amazing things you would have achieved, the father you would have been.   </p>

<p>I think of you every moment of every day, and I cannot stop crying. But one day I hope that will change. The day may come when I will still think of you every moment of every day, but maybe I will smile, instead, remembering the simply amazing person you were.   </p>

<p>For now I am still crying.   </p>

<p>From the Ackerman family, thanks to all of those who have shared their memories. Endi lives in your hearts, as he does in ours. To Endi’s friends: when the time comes that you have children of your own, I have a wonderful middle name I would like to suggest.   </p>

<p>Sam Ackerman</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p>Endicott, I met you earlier this year at Manly beach through a mutual friend of ours. We all spent a few hours together tanning under the sun and swimming in the ocean and having plenty of laughs. We had a great chat about our hopes for the future and our travels.</p>

<p>From just spending a day with you I could see the passion in your eyes when you spoke about the future or the things you enjoyed and the places you visited/wanted to visit. I could tell you were intelligent and hardworking. I could see you were caring and loving. You also had a beautiful smile that made anyone around you want to smile. I wish I had taken the step to organise for us all to catch up again but your passing has certainly affected me even though I met you once. </p>

<p>You’re loved by everyone and will continue to be in the hearts of those who met you. Rest in peace. Xx</p>
