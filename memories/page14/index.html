<p>I’m not sure what to say about this except wow. Olja and I were laughing through our tears the other night about the time Sam and Endi came to visit us in Philly and we went out to a local beer garden. When Endi walked through the door just about every female head in the place swiveled around. I don’t think he noticed, but we definitely did! (Full disclosure… I did buy Endi a few beers even though he was underage… don’t tell Liz)</p>

<p>I wanted to post this not only for everyone to see but to let Sam know I have always looked up to him as a model of what it means to be a father. I think a lot of the brash confidence and wit that Endi had came from you and from your and Liz’s loving embrace.</p>

<p>Three years ago today I became friends with Endi on Facebook. We only had one short and nonsense convo and I regret that I never texted him again. I regret that I was too anxious that he maybe might not remember me and will not answer. So for now I’ll have to wait till we meet again to get to know if he does remember me. But because of that I realized that life is too short for not doing things. Like Holden said in his speech, whatever it is we want to do we should do it now. And I will begin with this now. I will do what I want to do. I will do it now or at least as soon as possible and I will do it no matter if someone tells me I should better not. That’s what we all should do cause life is way too short to wait.</p>

				<p>Sam and Liz,</p>

<p>I am so, so sorry for you both, yet heartened by the reflections expressed here. Endi sounds like he was a terrific kid, his life a legacy of warmth and happiness for you, his siblings and his friends. You can’t ask for a better endorsement of the job you do as parents than the chorus you hear on this memorial page, even though tragedy has cut your time with him way too soon. I know you both professionally, and, I’m happy to say personally, and the pride and pleasure you take in your kids is apparent to everyone who works with you. As a fellow 4-kid parent, your loss cuts deep for me, as it does for every parent. But I see the strength and love you have built into the fabric of your family, and I know you will somehow find your way through this. Please know you have a lot of folks out here praying and pulling for you.</p>

<p>John</p>

<p>This is my favourite video of Endo! <br />
Bronte and I have been watching it non-stop and can’t help laughing. <br />
It was taken in my room last year at college, as me, Duncan, Allie and Endo were playing some silly game. <br />
We love how lively and in-character he is. He really steals the show. Makes me smile everytime. </p>

				<p>Dear Ackerman family,<br />
Of course and as usual, no words express our sorrow we feel at this time for your family and Endicott. Such a turmoil time for you all, and your community surrounding you. We knew you through Clifton Elementary and St Clare church. Liz, I remember teaching a CCD class with you and Endicott came in after his class and I said to you he was a special kid, at glance, not even really knowing him. You wrapped your arms around him tightly and kissed him and said “ yes, he is my sweet one, so kind to others, I love him.” We both laughed and said we wished we had had one more kid, to add to our 4. We both loved a big family, and all the different personalities it brought.<br />
Endicott lived a full life, the one he was supposed to, the one HE enjoyed. As hard as it is to understand, God had that plan. We never understand why things happen, and especially why they happen to “ good people.” But all of you will be stronger for it, and will touch more people in their lives, then you will know. The letter from Hannah to her brother was so beautiful and moving that I will remember many aspects from that and live my life with those thoughts and actions. Endicotts life and death will be meaningful. And what an honor that is. While the pain of losing a child, brother, relative, friend, etc never leave, his impact of being in this world will forever be a positive and meaningful memory for so many.<br />
Be so proud your Son, and brother. He is obviously so well loved and thought of. I wish for you so much peace and comfort. We are so very sorry for your loss. In Sympathy, The Jasien family</p>
