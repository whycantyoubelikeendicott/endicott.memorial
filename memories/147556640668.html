		<p>Dear Endi,</p>

<p>First of all, I miss you. Secondly, I’m writing to you from the beach in Wilmington and it’s 6:11am right now (this was kind of an impulsive excursion) and it’s the first time I’ve been to the water since everything happened. I know you’d think that’s weird because you know I love the ocean, and the weather has been perfect, and I live 5 minutes away, and yes, now I can see you rolling your eyes at me and shaking your head in disappointment… but anyway, I’ve just been very hesitant to come back. But I want you to know that being here is bringing me more peace and clarity than I’ve had in weeks. I think I really needed the air and the sounds and the solidarity to collect my thoughts. So this is where I am with it; here are some thoughts and memories that come to mind…</p>

<p>It’s no Rehoboth, but I can still smell Nicola’s and Grotto’s pizza, and I remember how my stomach felt that time I tried to keep up with you, slice for slice. I know that any beach I visit, I’ll think of you, and the memories that will rush back will be happy ones. And the beach isn’t the only place I’ll think of you, because I know I’m going to visit my favorite place from my childhood. And you happen to be a very big part of why that place exists for me. When I visit camp, Endi, I’ll sit on the bluff bench and remember our ‘corny’ conversations about the future of friendship, I’ll think about all the traditions we said we’d continue, and how you made my laugh echo off the bay at 3am. And, Endi, when I play volleyball, my lifelong pastime, I’ll think about how I was going to go to Tamarama beach with you, and I’ll remember to make plans to go there to play. Also, I wasn’t sure if I could handle it at first, but now I know that my first puppy will be a Leonberger. I really can’t wait to love that dog, Endi. I hope the backyard will be big enough. If it is, I’ll want to play ultimate, and I know that all my best disc tosses I’ll have learned from you.</p>

<p>I’m never going to forget categories in the pool. It doesn’t even bother me that you won, EVERY time. No matter what obscure category your dad could come up with. I never figured out if it was because you were just really good at quick thinking in mid-air or if it was because of your athleticism. Could be both. I’m positive that you gave yourself extra milliseconds by treading water during your descent. Endi, I want you to know how much you mean to me. There’s no way to describe growing up so close in age to someone whose family is so close to mine. Parts of my personality are due to the hours and hours we’ve spent together. You’ve shown me ways to live that I would have never seen from anyone else, shown me things to smile at that I wouldn’t have appreciated otherwise. Your wit is clever and constant and sarcastic and sometimes hilariously inappropriate,…I wonder where you get it from (;  And you are so kind… So deeply kind and genuine and gentle and passionate and I know where you get that from…the humor and love is family wide.</p>

<p>That picture of us on the stairs is absolutely my favorite picture, and undoubtedly a perfect still frame of my love for you, and how I have loved you since I was at least that small. And I always will love you, Endi. Thank you for giving me plenty of stories to tell my children, and thank you for teaching me things that I could have only learned from someone as humorous and brotherly as you. So, Endicott, thank you for every memory, and thank you for being such a significant part of my childhood, because I know that, even now, you are capable of evoking pieces of me that no one else can.</p>

<p>I started writing this three weeks ago, and it’s taken me this long to realize<br />
that this letter to you will never be finished…</p>

<p>The sunrise was spectacular this morning, Endi, I’m sure you saw it from wherever you are. I know you’d call me a lame tourist for it, but I watched the sky from the splintery lifeguard stand.</p>

<p>You are forever a part of my life, Endi. I hope to live as freely and passionately as you. I won’t stop learning from your example. I want to help people I love to live like that too.</p>

<p>You will forever have my love. You were truly my first love. And none of that will ever change. I will always have moments where I think of you, and I know that I’m not alone in this. You’ll always be with us, Endi. And I have no doubt that I will one day see you again.</p>

<p>Bella</p>
